iOS Test Notes

any instructions that I'll need to build and run the app (eg. if there's 
a particular VM I should use)

	- I used Xcode 7.3.1 to build and run. Tested on iPhone 6s (device and simulator).

notes on technical decisions you made, and the pros / cons of that approach

	- I originally loaded each product individually, but switched to loading 
		in 10 item blocks to reduce API requests.
	- iOS doesn't allow much control over URL caching, so to cache API requests
		for 1 hour I append the date to the URL request rounded to the nearest hour.
	- I decided not to use the 'onlyInStock', API option, instead saving in stock items
		in a separate data structure. This way there is no need for another API request
		on the switch toggle.
	- I used a UICollectionView instead of a UITableView for it's support for horizontal
		and vertical cells.

recommendations that you would want to see followed up if this were the 
beginning of a long-term project. What kinds of things do you look for 
in the code, technology choices, team practices etc. that can help to 
make a project successful?

	- I like to be able to directly work with the backend developer to customize the 
		API if needed, to optimize the app.
	- I like working on teams who follow the same set of coding standard rules.
	- I like working with developers who comment their code well.
